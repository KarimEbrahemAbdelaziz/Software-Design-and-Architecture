# Module 1 Notes

## Object-Oriented Thinking
By using objects to represent things in your code, the code stays **organized**, **flexible**, and **reusable**.

## Design in the Software Process
Software is developed through a process, generally iterative. The iterations consist of taking a set of requirements based on the identified problem(s) and using them to create **conceptual design** mock-ups and **technical design** diagrams, which can then be used to create a working software implementation, which must also pass testing.

It is important to allot time to form the requirements and design, even if they are not perfectly established.

**Requirements** are conditions or capabilities that must be implemented in a product, based on client or user request. They are the starting point of a projectâ€”you must understand what your client wants.

### Conceptual Design
The *conceptual design* recognizes appropriate **components**, **connections**, and **responsibilities** of the software product.

Conceptual designs are expressed or communicated through **conceptual mock-ups**. These are visual notations that provide initial thoughts for how requirements will be satisfied. Mock-ups for software involving user interfaces are often presented as reframes, which are a kind of blueprint or basic visual representation of the product.

### Technical Design
Technical designs build on conceptual designs and requirements to define the technical details of the solution.

In order to accomplish this, technical designs begin by splitting components into smaller and smaller components that are specific enough to be designed in detail. By breaking down components more and more into further components, each with specific responsibilities, you get down to a level where you can do a detailed design of a particular component. The final result is that each component will have their technical details specified.

In order to communicate technical design, technical diagrams are used. Technical diagrams visualize how to address specific issues
for each component.
